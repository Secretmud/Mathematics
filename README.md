# Mathematics

Tasks solved during my degree numerical and maybe analytical at some point. 

We mainly use matlab but I want to get better at C, I've therefore started to implement
the tasks I've gotten using C. 

Hanoi is the only recursive function I've written for this course. Not that the implementation is that hard.
